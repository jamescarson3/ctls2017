# Welcome to Computational Techniques for Life Sciences

### What is the Texas Advanced Computing Center?

A little about us:

 * We are a research center at UT Austin
 * ~160 Staff, 85% funding from external grants
 * We support over 10,000 users on ~2,300 active projects

*Mission: "To enable discoveries that advance science and society through the application of advanced computing technologies."*

### Basic High Performance Computing (HPC) System Architecture

As we log in and prepare to use Lonestar5, it is important to understand the basic architecture. Think of an HPC resource as a very large and complicated lab instrument. Users need to learn how to:

 * Interface with it / push the right buttons (Linux)
 * Load samples (data)
 * Run experiments (jobs)
 * Interpret the results (data analysis / vis)

### Tips for Success

*Read the [documentation](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides).*

 * Learn node schematics, limitations, file systems, rules
 * Learn about the scheduler, queues, policies
 * Determine the right resource for the job

HPC systems are shared resources. Your jobs and activity on a cluster, if mismanaged, can affect others. TACC staff are always [available to help](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-consulting).

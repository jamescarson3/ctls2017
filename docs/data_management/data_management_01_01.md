# Why Do We Need Data Management?

#### Digital research, especially biological, creates larges amounts of complex data
 + 3 Billion base-pairs in the 23 human chromosome pairs
 + 20,000+ humangenes
 + 60,000+ human protein variants
 + measurement of the expression patterns of all these requires many files for each element of the biology central dogma
 
 <br>

* Data complexity
  + huge numbers of files, particularly counting the meta-data relating data-to-data
  + large storage capacity needed, either for individual files or collectively

 <br>
 
 + This data varies in format and type
   * raw text
   * delimited text
   * binary (not human readable)
   * often extreme differences in storage requirements or limitations


* Without a management plan:
  + protecting, sharing, and even locating data can be a challenge
* With a plan:
  + researchers can focus on their areas of expertise
  + management policies can be automated
  + scientific replication, open-access, and cross-collections can be created, curated, and maintained

#### Example:
* Given 100 similarly named files in a directory
`file0.dat - file100.dat`
  + DISCUSS: what can we guess about this data?
    * *very little*


* Over these modules, we'll discuss data organization best practices for improved computational efficiency, performance, and security.
